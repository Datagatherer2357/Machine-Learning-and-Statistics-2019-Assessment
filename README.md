### Boston Housing Data set

* This repository is for Machine Learning and Statistics.
* It is a project based on The Boston Housing Dataset, centered around specific analytics and machine learning techniques applied to it in order to answer a number 
of questions. 
* It is in the form a Jupyter Notebook, which demonstrates an investigation of the variables of interest and explores their relationships.
* The notebook contains Python code only.

* Software used to make this repository: Anaconda version 4.7.12; Jupyter Notebook version 5.50; Visual Studio Code version 1.39.2
* Libraries used with in the notebook include:
* Python: 3.7.5 
* scipy: 1.3.1
* numpy: 1.17.2
* matplotlib: 3.1.1
* pandas: 0.25.2
* sklearn: 0.21.3
* seaborn: 0.9.0
* tensorflow: 2.0.0
* keras: 2.2.4
---------------------------------
To run the Jupyter Notebook it is recommended that you first download the full Anaconda package from: https://www.anaconda.com/. Alternatively, you can use an NB viewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
* Once you have downloaded Anaconda, the Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows): "jupyter notebook".
* This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.
* For additional queries about running a notebook please see: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html
